# AwesomeTouch [WIP]
an awesome Android IDE for an even more awesome framework Love2D.. written in Godot.
# But why?
Developing with Love2D on-the-go is a hassle. There are no editors supporting Love2D so you need to:  
a) develop your game in the ~/lovegame/ folder and start 'LOVE for Android' every time you want to playtest.  
b) develop your game in any folder but zip and rename it every time you want to playtest.  
And since I'm getting into Love2D I want to write a performant and simple editor for Android.
# Why Godot??
My options for a platform are:
1. Love2D: can't properly work with files on Android
2. Android Studio: java
3. Godot: not really designed for tools
4. C++: I don't want to go insane
5. Kotlin: I ain't learning a new language just for one Android app
